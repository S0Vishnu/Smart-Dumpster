# Smart-Dumpster

    In the present scenario, the garbage that is placed at public places in the cities are overflowing due to increase in the waste every day. It creates unhygienic condition for the people and creates bad smell around the surroundings. Even waste are segregated manually using hands, this leads in spreading some deadly diseases & human illness, to avoid such a situations Smart Dumpster can be a used.

    The Smart Dumpster performs the operation of separating the bio degradable and non-biodegradable waste. It uses MQ 02 and IR Proximity sensor to detect the waste as degradable and non-degradable waste. The level of the dumpster is detected using ultrasonic sensor. The level of the dumpster is displayed using an LCD display. When the Dumpster reaches the threshold value (95), a message is sent to the authorized person via a text message. The message consists of link which holds the latitudinal and longitudinallocation of the Dumpster.

# Requirements

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS :

-> Arduino UNO ATmega328p
-> Transformers(step-down)
-> Geared DC Motors
-> MQ 02 Sensor
-> IR Proximity Sensor
-> GSM Module

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS :

->	Arduino IDE

# Conclusion

    The objective of the project has been achieved. By monitoring the level of the bins through sensors, it is possible to achieve a more efficient system than the current existing system. This system mainly concentrates on monitoring the waste management, providing a smart technology for waste segregation, avoiding human intervention, reducing human time and effort and which results in healthy and waste ridden environment. The proposed idea can be implemented for smart cities where the residents would be busy enough with their hectic schedule and wouldnâ€™t have enough time for managing waste.
